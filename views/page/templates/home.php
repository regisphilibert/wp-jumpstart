    <h3>Things of note</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phil is a hurridly conceived acronym made up for the sole purpose of flattering the ego of it's pseudo creator.</li>
        <li>Phil is an ever name changing boilerplate for creating one time static html content to be delivered for Backend integration.</li>
        <li>This version integrates with Wordpress</li>
        <li>The goal is to build up your js and styling src tools so you can keep using them in the final environement after BE integration.</li>
        <li>It uses Sass for style</li>
        <li>It uses Grunt for building the whole thing.</li>
    </ul>
